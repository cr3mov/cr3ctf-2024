# embedding

* Difficulty: Medium - Hard

## Description

This encoder seems strange, any idea how to break it?

## Solution

The idea is similar to problem **Reality** in Goocle CTF 2019, however the polynomial given in this challenge is complex polynomial.

To solve this challenge, we can treat the polynomial as real polynomial by taking the real part and imaginary part separately, and convert 8 shares given by the challenge into 16 shares.
